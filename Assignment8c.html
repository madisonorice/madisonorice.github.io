		<h2>Welcome to the Official Website of Věra Chytilová</h2>
		<p>Věra Chytilová was a Czech filmmaker and one of the most significant voices of the Czech New Wave movement. She was born on February 2, 1929, in Ostrava, Czechoslovakia (now the Czech Republic).</p>
		<p>Her most famous film, "Daisies" (1966), is a surrealist masterpiece that follows two young women who decide to rebel against society's expectations and indulge in a series of anarchic pranks. The film was controversial at the time of its release and was initially banned by the Czech government, but it has since become a cult classic and a landmark of feminist cinema.</p>
		<p>Chytilová continued to make films throughout her career, including "Fruit of Paradise" (1970), "Prefabricated Houses" (1989), and "Traps" (1998). She received numerous awards for her work, including the Order of Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk, the highest civilian award in the Czech Republic.</p>
