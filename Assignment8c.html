             and early feminist cinema. She was born on February 2, 1929, in <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Ostrava" target="_blank">Ostrava, Czechoslovakia.</a></p>

        <h3> <a href="https://mubi.com/films/daisies" target="_blank"> Daisies (1966)</a></h3>
        <p>Her most famous film, "Daisies" (1966), is a philosophical farce that follows two young 
         women, (Marie 1 and Marie 2) who decide to go on a rampant free-for-all because <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hnOwCJhNM0" target="_blank">"when everything is being spoiled...we'll be spoiled too" </a>
         In this, the Maries go against society's expectations and indulge in a series of anarchic 
         pranks. The film was highly controversial at the time of its release and because the film industry was state-controlled at the time of its release in 1966, it was actually banned by the 
        Czech government for six years. Since then it has become a cult classic and a landmark of feminist cinema.</p>
